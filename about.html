                    <p> Elixir School (formally Climax Sch) have been in existence for more than a decade. The School is well organized with Good/God fearing quality Teachers, situated in a good friendly learning environment. Their teaching experience has impacted a lot on my children, especially in rhythm and speech. In fact it is a good school to be recommended. </p>
